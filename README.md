# Meshes.jl

Generation and manipulation of triangular meshes.

## Features

1. Isosurface extraction via marching tetrahedra.
2. Export to PLY format.

## Coming soon, hopefully...

1. Basic mesh simplification.

## Code cleanup

1. Many type annotations should probably be removed or generalized.
2. There are probably lots of speed improvements to be had as I learn the ins and outs of idiomatic Julia.
